# Updated workflow:
# - Restricts CI to main branch pushes and pull requests for more controlled execution
# - Uses `npm ci` for reproducible and faster dependency installs in CI environments
# - Enables Node.js dependency caching to reduce build times
# - Replaces deprecated Playwright GitHub Action with `npx playwright install --with-deps`
#   to support Ubuntu 24.04 runners and ensure required system dependencies are installed
