<p><b>Quality assurance</b> (<b>QA</b>) is the term used in both manufacturing and service industries to describe the systematic efforts taken to assure that the product(s) delivered to customer(s) meet with the contractual and other agreed upon performance, design, reliability, and maintainability expectations of that customer. The core purpose of Quality Assurance is to prevent mistakes and defects in the development and production of both manufactured products, such as automobiles and shoes, and delivered services, such as automotive repair and athletic shoe design. Assuring quality and therefore avoiding problems and delays when delivering products or services to customers is what <a href="/wiki/ISO_9000" class="mw-redirect" title="ISO 9000">ISO 9000</a> defines as that "part of <a href="/wiki/Quality_management" title="Quality management">quality management</a> focused on providing confidence that quality requirements will be fulfilled".<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>1<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> This defect prevention aspect of quality assurance differs from the defect detection  aspect of <a href="/wiki/Quality_control" title="Quality control">quality control</a> and has been referred to as a <i>shift left</i> since it focuses on quality efforts earlier in product development and production (i.e., a shift to the left of a linear process diagram reading left to right)<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>2<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> and on avoiding defects in the first place rather than correcting them after the fact.
</p><p>The terms "quality assurance" and "quality control" are often used interchangeably to refer to ways of ensuring the quality of a service or product.<sup id="cite_ref-asq.org_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-asq.org-3"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>3<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> For instance, the term "assurance" is often used in a context such as: <i>Implementation of inspection and structured testing as a measure of quality assurance in a television set software project at Philips Semiconductors is described.</i><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>4<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> where <i>inspection and structured testing</i> are the measurement phase of a quality assurance strategy referred to as the DMAIC model (<a href="/wiki/DMAIC" title="DMAIC">define, measure, analyze, improve, control</a>). DMAIC is a data-driven quality strategy used to <i>improve</i> processes.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>5<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> The term "control" is the fifth phase of this strategy.
</p><p>Quality assurance comprises administrative and procedural activities implemented in a <a href="/wiki/Quality_system" class="mw-redirect" title="Quality system">quality system</a> so that requirements and goals for a product, service or activity will be accomplished.<sup id="cite_ref-asq.org_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-asq.org-3"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>3<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> It is the systematic measurement, comparison with a standard, and monitoring of processes in an associated feedback loop that confers error prevention.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>6<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> This can be contrasted with <a href="/wiki/Quality_control" title="Quality control">quality control</a>, which is focused on process output.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>7<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>Quality assurance includes two principles: "fit for purpose" (the product should be suitable for the intended purpose); and "right first time" (mistakes should be eliminated). QA includes management of the <a href="/wiki/Quality_(business)" title="Quality (business)">quality</a> of raw materials, assemblies, products and components, services related to production, and <a href="/wiki/Management" title="Management">management</a>, production and <a href="/wiki/Inspection" title="Inspection">inspection</a> processes.<sup id="cite_ref-StebbingQuality93_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-StebbingQuality93-8"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>8<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> The two principles also manifest before the background of developing (engineering) a novel technical product: The task of engineering is to make it work once, while the task of quality assurance is to make it work all the time.<sup id="cite_ref-pajsep_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pajsep-9"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>9<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>Historically, defining what suitable product or service quality means has been a more difficult process, determined in many ways, from the subjective user-based approach that contains "the different weights that individuals normally attach to quality characteristics," to the value-based approach which finds consumers linking quality to price and making overall conclusions of quality based on such a relationship.<sup id="cite_ref-GarvinWhatDoes84_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GarvinWhatDoes84-10"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>10<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

<p>During the time of the <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">First World War</a>, manufacturing processes typically became more complex, with larger numbers of workers being supervised.

</p><p>The company-wide quality approach places an emphasis on four aspects (enshrined in standards such as ISO 9001):<sup id="cite_ref-PraxiomISO17_28-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PraxiomISO17-28"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>28<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

<p>The quality of the outputs is at risk if any of these aspects is deficient.
</p><p>The importance of actually measuring Quality Culture throughout the organization is illustrated by a survey that was done by <i>Forbes Insights</i> in partnership with the American Society for Quality. 75% of senior or C-suite titles believed that their organization exhibits "a comprehensive, group-wide culture of quality." But agreement with that response dropped to less than half among those with quality job titles. In other words, the further from the C-suite, the less favorable the view of the culture of quality.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>29<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> A survey of more than 60 multinational companies found that those companies whose employees rated as having a low quality culture had increased costs of $67 million/year for every 5000 employees compared to those rated as having a high quality culture.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>30<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

</p><p>This in turn is supported by quality management practices which can include a number of <a href="/wiki/Business_system" class="mw-redirect" title="Business system">business systems</a> and which are usually specific to the activities of the <a href="/wiki/Business_unit" class="mw-redirect" title="Business unit">business unit</a> concerned.

<p>The term product assurance (PA) is often used instead of quality assurance and is, alongside project management and engineering, one of the three primary project functions. Quality assurance is seen as one part of product assurance. Due to the sometimes catastrophic consequences a single failure can have for human lives, the environment, a device, or a mission, product assurance plays a particularly important role here. It has organizational, budgetary and product developmental independence meaning that it reports to highest management only, has its own budget, and does not expend labor to help build a product. Product assurance stands on an equal footing with project management but embraces the customer's point of view.<sup id="cite_ref-pajsep_9-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pajsep-9"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>9<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>
